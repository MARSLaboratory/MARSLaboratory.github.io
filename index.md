## Research Areas

- **Robotic Additive Manufacturing (WAAM)**  
  Process development, path planning, and control for large-scale metallic components.

- **AI for Process Monitoring and Control**  
  Neural and physics-informed models for real-time prediction and correction.

- **Hybrid Manufacturing Systems**  
  Integration of additive and subtractive operations within intelligent robotic frameworks.
